The controller setup and reconciliation flow are only partially implemented in the current codebase. Let me explain what's available and what's missing:

  1. Initialization:
    - The main.go file shows the controller initialization
    - Manager is set up with scheme, metrics, leader election
    - ResourceQuotaEnforcerReconciler is initialized and registered with manager
  2. Controller Implementation:
    - The file named controller.go actually contains a webhook implementation, not the controller reconciliation logic
    - The webhook blocks new resources in namespaces that have exceeded critical thresholds
    - The actual ResourceQuotaEnforcerReconciler implementation is missing
  3. Complete Flow:
  When deploying a sample CR:
    a. The manager would watch for ResourceQuotaEnforcer resources
    b. When one is created, it would trigger the reconciler (missing)
    c. The reconciler would check resource usage against quota
    d. Status would be updated with usage metrics and alerts
    e. If critical thresholds are exceeded, IsBlocking would be set to true
    f. The webhook would then block new resources in affected namespaces

  To complete this operator, you'd need to implement the reconciler that performs resource usage checks and updates the CR status.
